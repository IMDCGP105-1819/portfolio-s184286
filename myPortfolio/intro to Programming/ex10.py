Task 1

FizzBuzz has been used as a common challenge during programmer interviews, it requires the
interviewee to write code that prints the numbers between 1 and 100 with the following rules:

•If a number is divisible by 3, print “Fizz”
•If a number is divisible by 5, print “Buzz”
•If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print “FizzBuzz”
•Otherwise, print the number

Implement a function that will work through FizzBuzz for the specified number range. Your program
should ask the user for a high and low value before running the function.

Save your program as ex10.py.
