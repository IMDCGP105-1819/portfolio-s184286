"""
Task 2

Python can generate random numbers using a function provided by the random library. At the start
of your file, place the following line of code:

from random import randomint

This gives us access to the randomint function â€“ which takes two integer arguments; low and high. It
returns a random value between (and including) those two limits.

Write a function that selects a random number and then asks the user to guess what that number is.
They should be told if they are higher or lower than the result, track the number of guesses they
take to get the correct value. If they do not guess correctly, ask them again until they do.

Save your code as ex11.py.
