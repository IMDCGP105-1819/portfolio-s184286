Consider the game of poker (the variant does not matter), 
break down the elements into objects that you could represent with classes. 
As a starting point think about:  
a card, the deck of cards, a hand of cards (or the player who holds the hand). 

How would you represent each of those objects? 
What are their attributes? 
What data do they need to hold? What methods? 
How might you sensibly represent the data?
Write code to represent each object as a class, 
build a small application that will “deal” a hand of 5 cards objects. 
It should print each hand to the console in a sensible format and then allow another hand to be dealt – continuing through until there are not enough cards left in the deck.
The deck should be shuffled at the start of the process (and again if all cards are dealt out). 
Consider how you might shuffle the deck, what approaches might you take to organise your list of cards into a random order?
Your code should be commented to explain your thinking about each step of the process, write some test functions that demonstrate that your classes work as expected.
